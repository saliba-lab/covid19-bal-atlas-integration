Welcome to the `atlas-feature-selection-benchmark` wiki!

This project aims to evaluate the effect of feature selection on the ability to integrate multiple single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) samples to construct a reference "atlas", and how that atlas can be used to annotate an unseen query dataset.
To achieve this goal we have constructed a robust benchmarking pipeline using [**Nextflow**](https://www.nextflow.io/).

More detail on the project can be found on the other pages of the wiki:
